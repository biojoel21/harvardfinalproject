## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Invoices Application built using Django. The application allows users to manage invoices, clients, and suppliers. Users can create, read, update, and delete invoices for clients and suppliers. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface and provides a seamless experience for managing invoices.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project stands out due to its complexity and distinctiveness. Unlike other projects, it involves a more complex data model, including relationships between invoices, clients, and suppliers. It also includes a pagination feature, which is not commonly found in other projects. The application is built using Django, a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. This adds to the complexity as it involves understanding and implementing Django's various components such as views, templates, and models.
